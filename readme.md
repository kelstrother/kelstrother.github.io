## Project Description
This will be my personal portfolio in which I will use to display the talents I have to offer a potential employer. I will utilize my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScrips and jQuery to make the portfolio come to life. It will be easy to navigate, consice and to the point, engaging and pleasing to the eye all while being responsive on all platforms.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.
Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.
